# API Test for endpoints /posts and /comments on  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
To run the test, you need to enter the 'task2_api_test' directory and then find the 'api_tests.sln' solution and run it in Visual Studio. In the Test Explorer, run all the tests and wait for the result. 

In order to run the tests properly, you must have all the frameworks listed under "Technology".

## Technology
In this case I wrote code using Visual Studio. To perform the task I used C# with the frameworks:
- xUnit
- HttpClient
- Newtonsoft.Json
- System.Text
