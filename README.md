# BenefitSystems_task
This repository was made for 2 tasks solutions from BenefitSystems for the position of Information Systems Tester

## Structure
The repository consists of two directories, each presenting the solution to a separate task. Task 1 about UI testing is done in TypeScript while API testing is done in C#, which caused some problems.

## Problems
Unfortunately, I was not able to make the project consistent (because of differen technologies I used) and therefore each task should be run in a different IDE. When writing API tests in Typescript, I had a little trouble setting up in Visual Studio Code (this is the IDE with which I am most familiar). I considered creating two separate repositories on Github but in the end I stayed with one.
